### What is this repository for? ###

Current application consists of:

* post code lookup front-end (Angular 2) uses api layer to retrieve and show data. 
* middle layer that returns data from the SQLServer database using Web API and uses google services for autocomplete and getting an image from google static maps.
* data Importer - data to the database is imported from the csv files provided. (data gets refreshed once in 6 month). The importer is ran manually. 
* There are applications for 3 regions Australia (master branch), New Zealand and Singapore - different data sources, different logic.
